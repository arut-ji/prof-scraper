## Does your code build properly with "stack build"?

- Yes it does.

## Are there any parts of the specification you did not implement in part A?

- I have implemented all of the required bits for part A.

## For the 'stretch' part B, which libraries did you use and what kind of output did you generate?

- An additional library is "blaze-html", it is used as an DSL library for generating HTML tags.
- When executing `stack run`, a HTML file containing a bar chart - representing numbers of professors from each school - is created, and named "index.html".
